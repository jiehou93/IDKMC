# IDKMC
This is IDKMC--Irradiation and Desorption Kinetic Monte Carlo

IDKMC is an object kinetic Monte Carlo program for modelling defect evolution in materials during particle irradiation or thermal desorption.

At this stage, IDKMC is a closed source program for private communation only. Please do not distribute it pubically.
